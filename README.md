# Ecommerce Customers Problem

- Problem Statement

An Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. Lets's figure it out!
Let's get started!

- Dataset 

We'll work with the Ecommerce Customers csv file from the company. It has Customer's information such as Email, Address, and their color Avatar. Then it also has numerical value columns:

    Avg. Session Length : Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
    Time on App : Average time spent on App in minutes
    Time on Website : Average time spent on Website in minutes
    Length of Membership : How many years the customer has been a member.
    Yearly Amount Spent : Amount spent on items yearly

- conclusion

How can you interpret coefficients generated from code ?

1) Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in Avg. Session Length is associated with an increase of 25.98 total dollars spent.
2) Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in Time on App is associated with an increase of 38.59 total dollars spent.
3) Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in Time on Website is associated with an increase of 0.19 total dollars spent.
4) Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in Length of Membership is associated with an increase of 61.27 total dollars spent.

- Do you think the company should focus more on their mobile app or on their website?

With respect to analysis this is tricky, there are two ways to think about this :- Develop the Website to catch up to the performance of the mobile app, or develop the app more since that what is working better. OR 

Depends on the goal, there are two ways to interpret:

    1) Time on App because 1 unit increase here can cause greater revenue per year as compared to Time on Website.
    2) Time on website because it is the weakest and the company needs to improve it further.
